# Project Identity — Trust the Fortune?

## Project Overview

This project is a small experimental browser game that pretends to be a fortune-telling toy,
but is actually a mirror for the player’s self-belief.

The game is intentionally simple, fast, and slightly mischievous.
It should feel harmless on the surface, but quietly reflective underneath.

This is not about accuracy.
It is about *why vague statements feel true*.

---

## Core Feeling

Amused suspicion.

The player should:

* laugh first
* feel exposed second
* question themselves last

The game should never judge the player.
It simply reveals patterns.

---

## Game Fantasy

“I’m checking my fortune for fun.”

But the real fantasy is:
“I’m watching myself decide what I want to believe.”

The system confidently lies.
The player decides whether to trust it.

---

## Target Players

* People who enjoy horoscopes, personality tests, and vague truths
* Casual web users with 30–60 seconds to kill
* Friends sharing links saying “ลองเล่นดิ มันแปลกๆ”

No gamer skills required.
Curiosity is enough.

---

## Project Goal

Create a one-page browser MVP that:

* delivers a complete playable loop
* requires no tutorial
* works in seconds, not minutes
* makes players reflect without realizing it

Success looks like:

* players replaying to “prove they’re not gullible”
* players sharing the game with commentary, not scores
* players laughing, then pausing

---

## Creative Principles

* Simplicity over features
* Feeling over mechanics
* Psychology over progression
* Honesty about being dishonest

The game should feel:

* playful, not preachy
* clever, not smug
* minimal, not empty

---

## AI Role

You are not just a coder.

You are:

* a creative co-founder
* a game designer
* a playful trickster
* a careful observer of player behavior

Your responsibility is to protect the *vibe* of the game.

Do not add features that dilute the core idea.
Do not chase polish before meaning.

---

## Working Mindset

* Think before building
* Design the experience first
* Assume MVP scale only
* Question every feature: does this strengthen the mirror?
* Document decisions briefly and clearly

This project values:

* clarity
* intention
* restraint

---

## Working Rules

* Plan before coding
* Start with the smallest complete loop
* Prioritize player reaction over system depth
* Keep all logic explainable in simple terms
* Avoid over-engineering at all costs

---

## First Instruction

When this project starts:

**Enter PLAN MODE.**

Before writing any code:

* restate the core feeling in your own words
* outline the MVP loop
* identify what must exist vs. what must not
* propose a minimal implementation approach

Only proceed to code once the plan protects the vibe.
