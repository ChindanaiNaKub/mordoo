# Project: Trust the Fortune?

## Core Feeling
Amused suspicion.
The player feels entertained, slightly exposed, and quietly questioned.

## Game Fantasy
“I am checking my fortune.”
But actually:
“I am watching myself decide what I want to believe.”

## Target Players
- People who enjoy personality tests, horoscopes, and self-reflection
- Casual web users with 30 seconds to kill
- Friends sharing links saying “ลองเล่นดิ มันแปลกๆ”

## Core Loop (MVP)
1. Player requests a fortune (optional birthday input)
2. System presents a fortune (either random or biased by past answers)
3. Player answers: “ใช่เราเลย” / “ไม่ใช่เรา”
4. System reveals whether the fortune was random or tailored
5. Trust score adjusts
6. Loop repeats

## Why This Game Should Exist
Because people don’t believe everything —
they believe what feels right.

This game exists to gently expose that habit,
without judgment,
without preaching,
and without pretending to be smart.

It’s a toy.
It’s a trick.
It’s a mirror.
