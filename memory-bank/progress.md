## Development Log

### 2025-01-12 — Project Initialization

**Completed:**
- Created project identity document (`project-identity.md`)
- Created game design document (`game-design-document.md`)
- Set up git repository
- Created CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
- Established memory-bank folder structure with:
  - game-design-document.md
  - tech-stack.md
  - implementation-plan.md
  - architecture.md
  - progress.md (this file)

**Project Status:** Concept phase — design documents complete, no code written yet.

**Decisions Made:**
- Core feeling: Amused suspicion
- Target: Thai-speaking casual web users
- Platform: Single-page browser application
- Scope: MVP only, no feature creep

---

### 2025-01-12 — Technical Planning Complete

**Completed:**
- Finalized tech stack: Vanilla JavaScript + Vite + localStorage
- Created detailed implementation plan with 4 phases
- Finalized system architecture with component breakdown
- Documented core mechanics (fortune generation, trust scoring, reveal system)
- Updated all memory-bank files with technical specifications

**Tech Stack Finalized:**
| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Framework | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) |
| Build Tool | Vite |
| Styling | Plain CSS |
| Persistence | localStorage |
| Fonts | Google Fonts (Sarabun) |
| Deployment | Static hosting (any) |

**File Structure (7 files):**
```
mordoo/
├── index.html              # Single page app
├── style.css               # All styling
├── app.js                  # Main controller
├── fortune-engine.js       # Fortune generation
├── game-state.js           # State & persistence
├── ui-controller.js        # DOM manipulation
└── fortunes.json           # Fortune content (Thai)
```

**Core Mechanics Defined:**
- Fortune generation (random vs. tailored, 40/60 after 3 rounds)
- Trust score calculation (4 scenarios, 0-100 range)
- Reveal system (shows mode, message, score change)
- Theme affinity tracking (matches player's "yes" patterns)

**Project Status:** Planning complete, ready for Phase 0 implementation

**Decisions Made:**
- No backend (client-side only)
- No framework (vanilla JS)
- No accounts (localStorage)
- Minimal UI (centered, mobile-first)
- Thai language focus (Sarabun font)

---

### 2025-01-12 — Updated: 5-Round Limit

**Changes:**
- Added round counter (shows "รอบที่ X/5")
- Game now ends after 5 rounds (previously infinite)
- Added end screen with final stats
- "เล่นใหม่" (Play Again) button to reset
- Improved pacing: shorter experience as requested

**Rationale:**
- User feedback: 5 rounds feels better than infinite play
- Creates a complete narrative arc
- Players get a satisfying conclusion
- Final reflection: "คุณเชื่อสิ่งที่อยากเชื่อ ใช่ไหม?" (Do you believe what you want to believe?)

---

### 2025-01-12 — Game Complete & Deployed! 🎉

**Completed:**
- Built complete playable game loop
- Implemented all 4 core mechanics:
  - Fortune generation (random/tailored with 40/60 split after 3 rounds)
  - Trust score system (4 scenarios, 0-100% range)
  - Reveal system (RANDOM/BASED ON ANSWERS with Thai messages)
  - Theme affinity tracking (5 categories, self-doubt/ambition/relationships/introspection/social)
- Created 25 high-quality Thai fortunes (Barnum-style)
- Implemented mystical CSS theme (dark background, animated stars, moon)
- Built for production (~19KB gzipped, well under 50KB target)
- Deployed to GitHub Pages

**Tech Stack Final:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules)
- Vite (dev server + build tool)
- Plain CSS (mystical theme with animations)
- localStorage (persistence, no backend)
- Google Fonts Sarabun (Thai language support)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

**Bundle Sizes:**
- HTML: 2.43 kB (gzipped: 0.93 kB)
- CSS: 6.68 kB (gzipped: 1.88 kB)
- JS: 9.93 kB (gzipped: 3.30 kB)
- **Total: ~19 KB gzipped**

**Project Status:** ✅ LIVE at https://chindanainaKub.github.io/mordoo/

**Decisions Made:**
- No backend (client-side only for simplicity)
- No framework (vanilla JS for speed and minimal overhead)
- Mystical visual theme (dark, stars, moon as requested)
- GitHub Pages deployment (as requested)
- Polished MVP ready for wider sharing (as requested)
