# Game Design Document — Trust the Fortune?

## Core Feeling

**Amused suspicion.**

The player feels entertained, slightly exposed, and quietly questioned.

The emotional progression:
1. Laughs first
2. Feels exposed second
3. Questions themselves last

---

## Game Fantasy

Surface fantasy: "I am checking my fortune."

Real fantasy: "I am watching myself decide what I want to believe."

The system confidently lies. The player decides whether to trust it.

---

## Target Players

* People who enjoy personality tests, horoscopes, and self-reflection
* Casual web users with 30–60 seconds to kill
* Friends sharing links saying "ลองเล่นดิ มันแปลกๆ" (Try it, it's weird)

No gamer skills required. Curiosity is enough.

## Player Experience

### The Loop (MVP)

1. **Request** — Player asks for a fortune (optional birthday input)
2. **Present** — System displays a fortune (random or tailored based on history)
3. **Respond** — Player answers: "ใช่เราเลย" (That's me) / "ไม่ใช่เรา" (Not me)
4. **Reveal** — System shows whether fortune was random or personalized
5. **Adjust** — Trust score updates based on accuracy of player self-perception
6. **Repeat** — Loop continues

### Desired Outcomes

Players should:
* Replay to "prove they're not gullible"
* Share the game with commentary, not scores
* Laugh, then pause

## Project Goals

Create a one-page browser MVP that:

* Delivers a complete playable loop
* Requires no tutorial
* Works in seconds, not minutes
* Makes players reflect without realizing it

## Why This Game Should Exist

Because people don't believe everything — they believe what feels right.

This game exists to gently expose that habit:
* Without judgment
* Without preaching
* Without pretending to be smart

It's a toy. It's a trick. It's a mirror.

## Creative Principles

* **Simplicity over features**
* **Feeling over mechanics**
* **Psychology over progression**
* **Honesty about being dishonest**

The game should feel:
* Playful, not preachy
* Clever, not smug
* Minimal, not empty
